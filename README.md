B-SIDER: Computational algorithm for complementary beta-strand sequences

The original work was published in 

Yu, Tae-Geun, Hak-Sung Kim, and Yoonjoo Choi. "B-SIDER: computational algorithm for the design of complementary Î²-sheet sequences." Journal of chemical information and modeling 59.10 (2019): 4504-4511.


The practical guide will be published soon in a chapter of a book entitled "Computational Peptide Science".
